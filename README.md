# UofT Course Parser
##What is UofT Course Parser?
UofT Course Parser is going to be an API that gives you all (or some - it's up to you) the courses offered in a particular term at UofT along with the course's description, prerequisites, exclusions and so on.
It gets this data by parsing through the timetable and UofT coursefinder and stores it in a database to be used by the API
